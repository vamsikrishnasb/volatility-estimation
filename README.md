# About

The code takes as input the open, high, low, and close data and estimates the historical volatility for multiple timeframes.

The following volatility measures are computed:
1. 20-day / 40-day / 60-day / 80-day close-to-close historical volatility
2. 20-day / 40-day / 60-day / 80-day close-to-open historical volatility
3. 20-day parkinson volatility

The code will work for any underlying price data.
